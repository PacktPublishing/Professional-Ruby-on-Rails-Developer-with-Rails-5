Install Bootstrap and start homepage - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 43
Create an integration test for the pages:

rails generate integration_test pages

Then within the class PagesTest, type in the two tests:

test "should get home" do
get pages_home_url
assert_response :success
end

test "should get root" do
get root_url
assert_response :success
end

run your test suite by typing in:
rails test

Add the two routes to the config/routes.rb file:
root "pages#home"
get 'pages/home', to: 'pages#home'

Run the tests again

Build out the pages_controller.rb file under app/controllers folder and add the home action

class PagesController < ApplicationController
def home
end
end

Now add a view for home, create a folder named pages under app/views folder then within the pages folder create a file called home.html.erb and fill it in:
<h1>Welcome to MyRecipes App</h1>

Check out getbootstrap.com for homepage ideas, then build a mockup of your homepage

Add the bootstrap sass gem to your gemfile under your rails gem:
gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3.6'

can be 3.3.7 as well

If you are using Rails 5.1+ and you don't see a jquery-rails gem in your gemfile you will need to add this gem as well, so it would look like below:

gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3.7'

gem 'jquery-rails'

Install the gem in the app:
bundle install --without production

Then add the following line to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js file under the line that says //= require jquery_ujs:
//= require bootstrap-sprockets

If you are using Rails 5.1+ then you will need to add jquery here as well, so it would look like below:

//= require rails-ujs

//= require jquery

//= require bootstrap-sprockets

In the video an error is made here and the 'require' from the line above is left off, this will be corrected later
