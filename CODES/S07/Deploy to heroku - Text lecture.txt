Deploy to heroku - Text lecture
Section 7, Lecture 156
To deploy to production in heroku with real-time features you will need a verified heroku account which means having a credit card on file with them (no charge). Please go to https://heroku.com/verify and add in a credit card to your free account to turn it into a verified account, they won't charge anything unless you add paid features

Then add the redis add-on:
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev -a name_of_YOUR_heroku_app 

Then run:
heroku restart

If you want to see your REDIS_URL you can type in:
heroku config:get REDIS_URL

However we will not use this physically anywhere, we will refer to this as ENV["REDIS_URL"] for security

Go to config/cable.yml file and update production url to look like below:
url: <%= ENV["REDIS_URL"] %>

Go to config/environments/production.rb and scroll all the way to the bottom above the last end, add the following lines:
config.web_socket_server_url = "wss://mashrur-myrecipes.herokuapp.com/cable"
config.action_cable.allowed_request_origins = ['https://mashrur-myrecipes.herokuapp.com', 'http://mashrur-myrecipes.herokuapp.com']

***Make sure there are no separate lines in the statement above
Now open the gemfile and add the following gem to group :production:
gem 'redis'

Run: 
bundle install --without production

Create a file called redis.rb under config/initializers folder and fill it in:
$redis = Redis.new(url: ENV["REDIS_URL"]) if Rails.env.production?

Commit your code:
git add -A
git commit -m "make app production ready with actioncable"
git push

Then deploy to heroku:
git push heroku master

Run any pending migrations:
heroku run rails db:migrate

Now test it out from the browser, enjoy!
