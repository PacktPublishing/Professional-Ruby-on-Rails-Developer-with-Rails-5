TDD - validations for model - Text lecture
Section 4, Lecture 59
To correct a prior migration, it's a good idea to create a new migration file. In the prior video we demo how to correct the recipes table by using the following methods:

rename_column :recipes, :email, :description

basically first the table name, then the column name as it stands now (that you want to change) then the new column name

Then we use change_column to change the column type, notice how we refer to it as description here even though we're changing it in the line before in the same migration file

Then we ran the migration using rails db:migrate

Create a new test file for recipe model tests. Under test/models folder create a file named recipe_test.rb

Within it fill it in with the tests:

require 'test_helper'

class RecipeTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  
  def setup
    @recipe = Recipe.new(name: "vegetable", description: "great vegetable recipe")  
  end
  
  test "recipe should be valid" do
    assert @recipe.valid?
  end  
  
  test "name should be present" do
    @recipe.name = " "
    assert_not @recipe.valid?
  end
  
  test "description should be present" do
    @recipe.description = " "
    assert_not @recipe.valid?
  end
  
  test "description shouldn't be less than 5 characters" do
    @recipe.description = "a" * 3
    assert_not @recipe.valid?
  end
  
  test "description shouldn't be more than 500 characters" do
    @recipe.description = "a" * 501
    assert_not @recipe.valid?
  end
end

Fill in the validations in the recipe model:

validates :name, presence: true
validates :description, presence: true, length: { minimum: 5, maximum: 500 }
