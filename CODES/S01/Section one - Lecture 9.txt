Familiarity with IDE and command line - Text Lecture
Section 1, Lecture 9
Some helpful tips if you are using Codeanywhere:

- If the terminal stops working after a break, right click on Ruby on Rails folder (or whatever you have named your project) and click on Restart to restart the container

- If the terminal says something about rails not found and to run bundle install, it's probably because you changed ruby version from what it was before at default, which is fine. Check the default ruby and ensure you have set the default to the version of ruby which you had used when you created the rails application, otherwise you can switch to that version of ruby by typing in rom use ruby-2.3.4 for example

You can set the default to 2.3.4 if you want to avoid hassles, by typing in:

rvm --default 2.3.4

General and cloud9:

In the file tree/system widget:

- Check show home in favorites by clicking on it
- Un-check show root file system by clicking on it

In preferences, change soft tabs to 2 spaces under project settings

Some command line commands:
ls -> list - lists folders/files in the current directory of command line
cd .. -> change directory, move up 1 directory (don't forget the space and ..)
mkdir diretoryname -> creates a directory
example usage:
mkdir rails_projects -> this will create a directory called rails_projects 
in the current folder
cd directoryname -> moves into the directoryname directory from the current 
directory as long as directory is within current directory
example usage:
cd rails_projects -> this will move into rails_projects directory
clear -> clears the terminal screen and moves to the top

To run the rails server, type in the following command:
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

To run rails server in Codeanywhere: rails s --binding=0.0.0.0

To stop the rails server, hit control-c

Remember to run the server from the rails application folder, if you have 
followed along, workspace is the only rails application so far, so run it
from the workspace folder at this time
