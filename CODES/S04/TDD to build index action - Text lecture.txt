TDD to build index action - Text lecture
Section 4, Lecture 68
Issue the command to generate an integration test for recipes:
rails generate integration_test recipes

Write a test within the recipes_test.rb file generated in the test/integration folder:

test "should get recipes index" do
  get recipes_url
  assert_response :success
end

Add the route in the routes file:

get '/recipes', to: 'recipes#index'

Create a recipes_controller.rb file under app/controllers and fill it in:

class RecipesController < ApplicationController

end

Run the test and you'll find a fail for missing index action, therefore add in the index action in the recipes_controller.rb file:

def index

end

Now the failed test will say there is no template/view

Add this by first creating a recipes folder under app/views folder

Then within this recipes folder create an index.html.erb file

Now the tests should pass
