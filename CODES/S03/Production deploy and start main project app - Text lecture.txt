Production deploy and start main project app - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 41
To deploy your todoapp to production, create an account with heroku, ensure you confirm the account by clicking on the link in your email address

Then pull up your gemfile, move the sqlite3 gem to group development, test (ensure it's no longer in the top/main area of your gemfile)

Add the following group at the bottom:

group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end

Then run:
bundle install --without production

Then do another commit to capture the updates and modify the gemfile.lock file
git add -A
git commit -m "make app production ready"
git push

Then log-in to your heroku account:
heroku login

Enter in your email and password for your heroku account

Add your public ssh key to your heroku account:
heroku keys:add

Enter when asked whether to upload public ssh key to heroku: Y

Create a new production app in heroku:
heroku create

Rename it to something you like:
heroku rename yourname-todoapp

Deploy your local app to heroku:
git push heroku master

Then run the migrations in heroku:
heroku run rails db:migrate

Now check out your app at yourname-todoapp.herokuapp.com

Enjoy with family and friends!

Now let's start our main project app for this course:

Navigate out of todoapp and into rails_projects directory

From there (rails_projects directory), type in:
rails new myrecipes

This will build the new app

Test it out by typing in:
cd myrecipes

Then run the rails server:
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

Test out that you get the rails main welcome page from the browser, then shut down the server

Initiate a git repo:
git init

Then make a commit:
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a new repository in your github account, then follow the steps (two lines) to move existing app to your github repo

Then test it out and ensure your app is pointing to the right repo by typing in:
git remote -v

Reload the github page and ensure your latest commit/project is showing up

Congratulations!
