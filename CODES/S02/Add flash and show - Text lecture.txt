Add flash and show - Text lecture
Section 2, Lecture 30
Update the create action and add the following line below @todo.save
flash[:notice] = "Todo was created successfully"

In your views/layouts/application.html.erb you have to now display the flash, add the following code right under your opening <body> tag and above the yield:
<% flash.each do |name, msg| %>
<ul>
<li><%= msg %></li>
</ul>
<% end %>

In the todos_controller.rb file add the show action

def show
  @todo = Todo.find(params[:id])
end

In your views/todos folder create a view for show by creating a file named show.html.erb:

<h1>Showing a todo</h1>

<p>
name: <%= @todo.name %>
</p>
<p>
description: <%= @todo.description %>
</p>
