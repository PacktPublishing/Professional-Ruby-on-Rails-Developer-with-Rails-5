TDD to create new recipes - Text lecture
Section 4, Lecture 84
Complete the invalid recipe submission test in the recipes_test.rb file under test/integration folder:

test "reject invalid recipe submissions" do
  get new_recipe_path
  assert_template 'recipes/new'
  assert_no_difference 'Recipe.count' do
    post recipes_path, params: { recipe: { name: " ", description: " " } }
  end
  assert_template 'recipes/new'
  assert_select 'h2.panel-title'
  assert_select 'div.panel-body'
end

Update the routes file, remove all the recipe related routes and replace with:
resources :recipes

Ensure you have a chef defined in the db, if not, create a chef from the console

Add the create action and private recipe_params (just above the last end in the file) in the recipes_controller.rb file:
def create
  @recipe = Recipe.new(recipe_params)
  @recipe.chef = Chef.first
  if @recipe.save
    flash[:success] = "Recipe was created successfully!"
    redirect_to recipe_path(@recipe)
  else
    render 'new'
  end
end

private

  def recipe_params
    params.require(:recipe).permit(:name, :description)
  end

The styling for the error portion will be completed in the next video so the text will be added there
