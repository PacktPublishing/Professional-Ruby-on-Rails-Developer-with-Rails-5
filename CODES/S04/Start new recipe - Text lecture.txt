Section 4, Lecture 80
Add the tests to your recipe_test.rb test file under the test/integration folder:

  test "create new valid recipe" do
    get new_recipe_path
  end
  
  test "reject invalid recipe submissions" do
    get new_recipe_path
  end

Add the new recipe route to the routes.rb file in the config folder:
get '/recipes/new', to: 'recipes#new', as: 'new_recipe'

make sure to add it before the show route otherwise it won't work

def new
  
end
