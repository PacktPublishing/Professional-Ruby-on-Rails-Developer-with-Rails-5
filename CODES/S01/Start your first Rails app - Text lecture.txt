Start your first Rails app - Text lecture
Section 1, Lecture 15
To start a new rails application named todoapp, type in:

rails new todoapp

Navigate to todoapp, if you are in rails_projects directory:
cd todoapp

To start the server:
rails s -b $IP -p $PORT

To display hello world at root route, open the config/routes.rb file and enter in the following route:
root "application#hello"

Then in the application controller under the line protect_from_forgery.. add the following method:

def hello
  render plain: "hello world!"
end

save it, start the server (if you haven't already) and reload the page

well done!

Now to actually have a home page utilizing the controller and views (instead of rendering text like above):

change the routes.rb file line to
root "pages#home"

create a new file under controllers and call it pages_controller.rb, then fill it in:
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def home
  end
end

create a new folder under views called pages
within this pages folder under views, create a new file called home.html.erb then fill it in with the following:
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

To shut down the server:
ctrl-c
